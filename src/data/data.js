export const NAME = 'Nick Ooms';
export const TITLE = 'Senior Full-Stack Javascript Developer';
export const SUMMARY = `Started developing with Borland Turbo Pascal and later some x86 Assembly on a 4.77Mhz IBM PC some 25
years ago.
Executed my first XMLHttpRequest back in 1999 on IE5 and was immediately hooked on the freedom and
dynamic nature of JavaScript.
In the following years I developed a (now known as SPA or Single Page Application) framework based on a
self-developed XML dialect for defining fully functional, resizeable pixel perfect copies of Windows 7
(Windows XP at first with all 3 color themes, followed by office 2003, and later adopted Vista and the Aero
look).
I simply love Javascript and have been using it on front & back-end (Aptana Jaxer followed by Node.js) for
well over 15 years.`;
